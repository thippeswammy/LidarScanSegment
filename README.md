# ScanSegmentAPI

This project contains scripts written in Python which receive and parse scan segments from SICK LiDAR sensors, either in the Compact or in the MSGPACK format. The transport protocols UDP and TCP are supported.

The following product families are currently supported:
- multiScan100 (e.g. 1131164)
- picoScan100 (e.g. 1134610)
- LRS4000 (e.g. 1098855)

The scripts which do the actual parsing are located in `scansegmentapi/msgpack.py` and `scansegmentapi/compact.py` respectively. They are written and documented with the intention to support the understanding of the two data formats. The scripts are not optimized for performance and not intended to be used in productive code.

To quickly test that data from a SICK LiDAR sensor is received successfully on your client, the [command line tool](#using-the-command-line-interface) `scansegmentapi_cli.py` can be used. Hints for the configuration of the sensor and the network of the client PC can be found [here](#hints-on-sensor-and-network-configuration).

To use the parsers in a python script, this package can simply be imported as shown in the [examples below](#using-the-scansegmentapi-from-python).

Finally, sample binary files with MSGPACK data and Compact data are provided in ´tests/sample_files´. They can be used to check whether the parsing results of your own parser  match with the results of the scripts provided here. Some documentation on the sample binary files is found in [tests/sample_files/README.md](/tests/sample_files/README.md).

## Prerequisites

This project relies on [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and execution of the virtual
python environment. Detailed installation instructions for each platform can be found
[here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## Project setup

To install the project dependencies run:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

## Executing Python scripts in a Poetry environment

In general all Python scripts must be executed via Poetry either in a single command:

```bash
$ poetry run python <script1>
$ poetry run python <script2>
$ ...
```

or by first starting the Poetry shell:

```bash
$ poetry shell
$ python <script1>
$ python <script2>
$ ...
```

## Using the command-line interface scansegmentapi_cli.py

You can always view help with the built-in help option `--help, -h`:

```bash
$ poetry run python scansegmentapi_cli.py -h
```

This will display a list of the available subcommands. Further help on the subcommands and their options can be retrieved
using:

```bash
$ poetry run python scansegmentapi_cli.py <subcommand> -h
```

If no device is at hand, one of the provided sample files can be used to test if the project was correctly set up using
the `read` subcommand.

```bash
$ poetry run python scansegmentapi_cli.py read msgpack -i ./tests/sample_files/sample.msgpack
$ poetry run python scansegmentapi_cli.py read compact -i ./tests/sample_files/sample.compact
```

### Receiving data from a device

To receive segments sent by a SICK Lidar sensor the `receive` subcommand has to be used as follows:

```bash
$ poetry run python scansegmentapi_cli.py receive compact # or 'msgpack' respectively.
```

By default this command listens on `localhost` at port `2115` for incoming data via UDP.
If the device is located in a different subnetwork the ip address to use for listening can be changed using the `--ip` command-line option.
Note that depending on the transport protocol, the ip address is the ip address of the network adapter of the client PC, if UDP is used, or the ip address of the sensor, if TCP is used.

The port can be changed using `-p` or `--port` flag:
```bash
$ poetry run python scansegmentapi_cli.py receive compact --ip 192.168.0.100 --port 2115
```

The transport protocol can be selected between UDP and TCP using the `--protocol` argument.
The default is UDP.
For the protocols supported by your device refer to the manual.


## Using the ScanSegmentAPI from Python
To receive data from a SICK Lidar sensor in a Python script, the ScanSegmentAPI can be imported and the parsers can be instantiated.

Example for MSGPACK via UDP where the address `192.168.0.100` is the ip address of the network adapter of the client PC (not of the sensor!) and `2115` is the used port.

```python
import scansegmentapi.scansegmentapi.msgpack as MSGPACKApi
from scansegmentapi.scansegmentapi.udp_handler import UDPHandler

if __name__ == "__main__":
    transportLayer = UDPHandler("192.168.0.100", 2115, 65535)
    receiver = MSGPACKApi.Receiver(transportLayer)
    (segments, frameNumbers, segmentCounters) = receiver.receive_segments(200)
    receiver.close_connection()

```

Example for Compact via UDP where the address `192.168.0.100` is the ip address of the network adapter of the client PC (not of the sensor!) and `2115` is the used port.

```python
import scansegmentapi.scansegmentapi.compact as CompactApi
from scansegmentapi.scansegmentapi.udp_handler import UDPHandler

if __name__ == "__main__":
    transportLayer = UDPHandler("192.168.0.100", 2115, 65535)
    receiver = CompactApi.Receiver(transportLayer)
    (segments, frameNumbers, segmentCounters) = receiver.receive_segments(200)
    receiver.close_connection()
```

Example for Compact via TCP where the address `192.168.0.1` is the ip address of the sensor (not of the client PC!) and `2115` is the used port of the sensor.

```python
import scansegmentapi.scansegmentapi.compact as CompactApi
from scansegmentapi.scansegmentapi.tcp_handler import TCPHandler
from scansegmentapi.scansegmentapi.compact_stream_extractor import CompactStreamExtractor

if __name__ == "__main__":
    streamExtractor = CompactStreamExtractor()
    transportLayer = TCPHandler(streamExtractor, "192.168.0.100", 2115, 1024)
    receiver = CompactApi.Receiver(transportLayer)
    (segments, frameNumbers, segmentCounters) = receiver.receive_segments(200)
    receiver.close_connection()
```

**NOTE**

The above snippets assume that the code of the ScanSegmentAPI is located in a subdirectory of the current working directory named `scansegmentapi`. If you place your code directly in the directory with the ScanSegmentAPI code for example, the import statement has to be modified to `import scansegmentapi.msgpack` and `import scansegmentapi.compact` respectively.

## Examples
More examples of the usage of the ScanSegmentAPI can be found in the examples directory.

## Compact & MSGPACK API mapping table

## Hints on sensor and network configuration

If no data can be received from a SICK Lidar sensor or errors are reported in the data stream, here are some hints how to solve common problems.

### Configure correct IP address and port
If no data is received at all when using UDP, make sure that the correct port and the correct IP address of the client PC are configured on the sensor.

<img src="doc/port_and_ip_on_the_sensor.png" width="350"/>

If no data is received at all when using TCP, make sure that the correct port and the correct IP address of of the sensor is configured in the python script.

### Set network category to 'Private'

If UDP is used as the transport protocol on Windows PCs the network category of the used network adapter may need to be configured to 'Private'. To do so, open the Windows Powershell with administrator privileges and check the network category and the interface index of the network adapter which is used for communication with the Lidar sensor.

<img src="doc/get_net_connection_profile.png" width="350"/>


Then set the network category to 'Private' for the corresponding interface using the following command:

`Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceIndex <index as retrived> -NetworkCategory Private`

### Configure correct data format
If data is received but a CRC check error is shown as output of the Python script, a reason might be that the wrong output data format is configured on the sensor. Make sure that MSGPACK output is configured when using the MSGPACK Python API and Compact is configured when using the Compact Python API.

<img src="doc/format_selection_on_the_sensor.png" width="350"/>

## Jupyter Notebook support in Visual Studio Code

In order to use the scansegmentapi inside Jupyter notebooks executed inside Visual Studio Code the appropriate virtual environment
has to be selected as shown in the image below:

<img src="doc/poetry_jupyter.png" width="700"/>

In many cases, Visual Studio Code recognizes the correct virtual environment by itself.

## Extracting data packages from a TCP stream
In the case of UDP the extraction of the data from the UDP packet is straight forward because each UDP packet contains at most one measurement data package. In the case of TCP the measurement data packages have to be extracted from the TCP stream. In other words the TCP stream has to be split up into separate measurement data packages. For the Compact and MSGPACK protocol the data packages start with a delimiter and end with a checksum. The extraction of data packages from the TCP stream is implemented using state machines.

The state machine for the Compact format:

![Compact State Machine](doc/statemachine_compact.svg)

The state machine for the MSGPACK format:

![Msgpack State Machine](doc/statemachine_msgpack.svg)
