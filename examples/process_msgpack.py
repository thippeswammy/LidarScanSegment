# This program receives scan segments in MSGPACK format.
# The received data consists of a list of segments where
# each segment is represented as a dictionary, a list
# with frame counters and a list with segment counters
# which have the same length as the list of segments.
# This data is processed in the example below as follows:
#
# All segments with the segment counter 2 are extracted.
# For all these segments the frame number and the segment counter
# and the start angle of the first scan are retrieved and printed.

# Port used for data streaming. Enter the port configured in your device.
PORT = 2115

# If UDP is configured this should be the IP of the receiver.
# If TCP is configured this should be the IP of the SICK device.
IP = "192.168.0.100"

# Select with which transport protocol the data should be received. Select "TCP" or "UDP".
TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL = "UDP"
