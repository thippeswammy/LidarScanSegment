# This program receives scan segments in Compact format.
# The received data consists of a list of segments where
# each segment is represented as a dictionary, a list
# with frame counters and a list with segment counters
# which have the same length as the list of segments.
# This data is processed in the example below.
#
# All segments with the segment counter 2 are extracted.
# For all these segments the frame number and the segment
# counter for the first module and the start angle of the
# first scan of the first module are retrieved and printed.
