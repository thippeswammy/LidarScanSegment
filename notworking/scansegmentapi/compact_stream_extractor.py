    This class extracts Compact V4 formatted data packages from a stream of bytes.
    A Compact data package is composed of the following parts:
        * Header: 32 bytes
        * Modules: variable size
        * CRC (Checksum): 4 bytes
    The first four bytes of the header are the STX (Start of TeXt) sequence.
    The following four bytes are the command ID.
    Bytes 28 to 31 specify the size of the first module.

    Each module has some meta data. In this meta data the size of the next module is specified.
    To get this size the bytes which come before this field need to be skipped.
    The number of bytes to skip depends on the number of lines in the module.
    The number of lines is also specified in the meta data at byte 20 to 23.
    Once the number of lines is extracted the position of the next module size can be calculated.
    The next module size is located at byte 32 + 32 * number of lines.
    The last module in a Compact data package has a next module size of 0.

    The last module is followed by a CRC which is calculated over the header and the modules.

    The extractor is a state machine which can be in one of the following states:
        * WAITING_FOR_STX: The extractor is searching for the STX sequence.
        * WAITING_FOR_HEADER: The extractor is waiting for the header to be complete.
        * WAITING_FOR_MODULE_DATA: The extractor is waiting for the next module to be complete.
        * WAITING_FOR_CRC: The extractor is waiting for the CRC to be complete.
    After each module, or at the beginning, the extractor is in the WAITING_FOR_STX state.
    As soon as the STX sequence is found in the data the extractor changes to the
    WAITING_FOR_HEADER state. As soon as enough data is available for the header the extractor
    changes to the WAITING_FOR_MODULE_DATA state. The header specifies the length of the first
    module. The extractor waits until enough data is available for the first module. Each module
    specifies the length of the next module. The extractor stays in the WAITING_FOR_MODULE_DATA
    state until the last module specifies a length of 0 for the next module then the extractor
    changes to the WAITING_FOR_CRC state. Once enough data for CRC has been received the extractor
    changes back to the WAITING_FOR_STX state  and adds one package
    with measurement data to the list of data packages which is returned
    by the extractor.
