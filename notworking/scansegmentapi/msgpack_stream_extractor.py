    This class extracts Msgpack formatted data packages from a stream of bytes.
    A Msgpack data package is composed of the following parts:
        * STX: 4 bytes
        * size: 4 bytes
        * MSGPACK buffer: variable size
        * CRC (Checksum): 4 bytes
    The first four bytes of the data package are the STX (Start of TeXt) sequence.
    The following four bytes are the size of the payload.
    The MSGPACK buffer is followed by a CRC which is calculated over the MSGPACK buffer.

    The extractor is a state machine which can be in one of the following states:
        * WAITING_FOR_STX: The extractor is searching for the STX sequence.
        * WAITING_FOR_SIZE: The extractor is waiting for the size of the MSGPACK buffer.
        * WAITING_FOR_CRC: The extractor is waiting for the CRC.
    After each data package, or at the beginning, the extractor is in the WAITING_FOR_STX state.
    As soon as the STX sequence is found in the data the extractor changes to the
    WAITING_FOR_SIZE state. As soon as enough data is available to read the size of the payload
    the extractor changes to the WAITING_FOR_CRC state. Once enough data for the payload and the
    CRC has been received the extractor changes back to the WAITING_FOR_STX state and adds one
    package with measurement data to the list of data packages which is returned by the extractor.
