    In contrast to UDP where one UDP packet contains exactly one data package with measurement
    data (e.g. Compact or MSGPACK data), the measurement data packages arrive in a continuous
    data stream. Therefore the TCPHandler requires a stream_extractor which can assemble one
    measurement data package from the TCP stream. Note that different stream_extractors
    must be used, depending whether Compact or MSGPACK data shall be extracted.
